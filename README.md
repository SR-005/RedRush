## How it Works ?
1. A donor registers by entering their name, phone number, email, blood group, and location.  
2. A person in need can search by **blood group** and optionally filter by **location**.  
3. If matching donors are found in the same location, they are shown first.  
4. If no local donor is found, the app still lists all other donors of the required blood group in a separate section.  
5. Each donor card has direct **Call** üìû and **Email** ‚úâÔ∏è buttons for instant contact.
