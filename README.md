# NasaHub  

NasaHub is a platform designed to connect blood donors with people in urgent need of blood. Users can register themselves as donors by providing details like name, blood group, contact information, and location. People searching for blood can filter by blood group and location to quickly find suitable donors.  

This project ensures that emergency blood requirements can be fulfilled faster by making donor information more accessible and organized. It also provides direct call and email options for easier communication.  

This project is awesome because it makes life-saving connections possible within minutes üöë‚ù§Ô∏è.

## How it Works ?
1. A donor registers by entering their name, phone number, email, blood group, and location.  
2. A person in need can search by **blood group** and optionally filter by **location**.  
3. If matching donors are found in the same location, they are shown first.  
4. If no local donor is found, the app still lists all other donors of the required blood group in a separate section.  
5. Each donor card has direct **Call** üìû and **Email** ‚úâÔ∏è buttons for instant contact.
